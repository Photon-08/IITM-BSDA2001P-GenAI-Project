## 📖 Course Modules

### Session 2: Text Embeddings and Sentiment Analysis

**Topics Covered:**
- Traditional Embeddings: Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF
- Dense and Distributed Representations: Word2Vec and GloVe
- Transformer-Based Embeddings: BERT and advanced techniques
- Complete ML Pipeline: Preprocess → Embed → Train → Evaluate

**Resources:**
- Jupyter Notebook with hands-on implementation
- PDF slides covering embedding concepts
- Kaggle Competition: Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand different text representation methods
- Implement end-to-end sentiment analysis pipelines
- Experiment with different embeddings and classifiers
- Develop debugging skills using official documentation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Basic understanding of Machine Learning concepts
- Familiarity with Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Photon-08/IITM-BSDA2001P-GenAI-Project.git
cd IITM-BSDA2001P-GenAI-Project
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

3. For specific sessions, check the requirements in individual notebooks.

### Using the Materials

1. Navigate to the session folder you want to work on
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in your preferred environment (Jupyter Lab, Google Colab, etc.)
3. Follow the instructions and examples provided
4. Complete the assignments and homework tasks

## 💡 Key Learning Principles

### Problem-Solving Philosophy

As emphasized in the course materials:

> **"Your challenge is to solve issues by referring to official documentation first, not by using AI assistants like ChatGPT or Gemini."**

This approach helps you:
- Build core engineering skills
- Learn to debug independently
- Understand libraries deeply (scikit-learn, pandas, Hugging Face, etc.)
- Develop professional problem-solving abilities

## 📝 Project Workflow

The recommended workflow for your course project:

1. **Implement the Pipeline**: Apply the complete 4-step pipeline to your dataset
   - Preprocess the data
   - Embed the text
   - Train the model
   - Evaluate performance

2. **Establish a Baseline**: Start simple (e.g., TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)

3. **Experiment**: Try different embeddings and models to improve results

4. **Document**: Keep track of your experiments and results

## 🎓 Mentoring Sessions

Regular mentoring sessions are conducted to:
- Guide students through course concepts
- Answer questions and clarify doubts
- Provide hands-on coding examples
- Share best practices and tips

All session materials will be added to this repository after each session.
